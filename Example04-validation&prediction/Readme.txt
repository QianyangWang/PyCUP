2. The validation data is a generated example data series (not real data).
3. run the Validate.py for ensemble validation, run the Predict.py for ensemble prediction.
Note: The true validation process does not necessarily need you to put the model executable into the folder.
          The executable here is for the convenience that you can directly run the example scripts.
