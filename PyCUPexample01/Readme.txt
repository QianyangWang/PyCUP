This is an SWMM model calibration example using single-processing GLUE
*****PLEASE EXECUTE THIS PROJECT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATOR'S RIGHT IN CASE OF POPUP WINDOWS*****
1. The example SWMM model can be downloaded from https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm#downloads
2. The calibration data is a generated example data series (not real data).
3. run the Calibrate.py for model calibration, run the PostProcessing.py for uncertainty analysis.
4. the model executable and the model project file are located in the 'project' folder. 
Note: The true calibration process does not necessarily need you to put the model executable into the folder.
          The executable here is for the convenience that you can directly run the example scripts.
